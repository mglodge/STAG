# Code to take dipole positions from a file created by CORAl and visualise them in 3D. 
#
# INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:
# The input file "dipole_coords.txt" dipoles will be created automatically whenever CORAl analyses a DDSCAT-type 
# shape.dat file. Simply run this python script from the command line in the same folder to read this input file
# and visualise the shape in 3D. The plot is interactive and fully rotatable.
#
# This code also displays a Mie sphere of equivalent volume to the shape as a to-scale comparison.
#
# The code works on the mac it was designed on, but has not been tested on any other computers - please e-mail
# the following e-mail address if you have any questions or issues: matthew.g.lodge@gmail.com

# TROUBLESHOOTING
#
# This exact version is designed to produce two windows (side-by-side) on mac computers; however, this will not
# work if running on windows. Simply comment out any lines that produce errors as a workaround, e.g:
#
# - matplotlib.use("TkAgg") # use a backend to allow the current_fig_manager section to position the windows
# - plt.get_current_fig_manager().window.wm_geometry("+750+100")

# The final row gives information about the lattice dimensions, the number of dipoles, and the distance between dipoles - store this info before moving on
STAG_lattice_dim=dipoles['X'][len(dipoles)-1] # store the lattice dimension value
N=dipoles['Y'][len(dipoles)-1] # store the number of dipoles N from our program
d=dipoles['Z'][len(dipoles)-1]/1000000 # store the value of the spacing between dipoles "d". This is usually a float, but we need to import it as an int as part of the array to keep it as one import file - we export it from our program truncated in pico-metre units (so we still have the data in micrometres to 6 dp) and when we import it here, divide it by 1000000 to turn back into um units. This truncates some info but is accurate enough to plot on a graph for visuals here.
